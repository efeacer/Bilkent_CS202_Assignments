Question 2 is written in Xcode IDE in macOs platform. 
Makefile uses the g++ compiler, but it can be changed through the variable "CC".
The program can be built using the make command. The homework manual wants us to
 use "clock" from "ctime" to make our measurements. However, clock omits the 
fractional parts of the measurements when it is used in a windows platform (even 
when it is type-casted to a double or float & it does show the fractional parts in macOS).
